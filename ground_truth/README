The two log files here contain the normal sensor data from the robot and
a ground-truth pose. A ground-truth pose exists for each laser scan.

An image of the final map and trajectory is provided for each dataset.

Datasets:

* empty_environment: A simple environment with no obstacles in it. The robot
                     can always see the full extent of the environment.

* figure_eight: An environment with two obstacles (garbage cans) blocking the
                robot's field of view. The robot drives a figure-8 around the
                obstacles. Significant wheel slippage occurs at least once.


The ground-truth pose comes from our own implementation of A1 -- perhaps
a better name is simply the SLAM pose.  We hope that all students surpass
our SLAM implementation by the end of A1.
